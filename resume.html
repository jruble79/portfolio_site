                    I worked with graphics and photo editors to produce editorial layouts for news, business and special sections. I developed the conceptualization and production of major reports and book-sized special sections and thrived under deadline pressure to craft designs and illustrations with little supervision. Partnering with National Geographic, I created pages to promote their series “Mars” as well as on endangered species and the Apollo 11 mission. As interim assistant team leader in 2018, I planned meetings with editors and assigned story projects to layout designers.

                    I created layouts, illustrations and infographics for this newspaper based in the mountains of western North Carolina. I photo edited and designed a section on the life of evangelist Billy Graham, who lived in the region until his death in February 2018. I also assisted with a special section on the future of Mars exploration that was published across the country via various Gannett properties. In August 2017 I had the opportunity to design a special section in advance of what was dubbed “The Great American Eclipse” featuring an illustration by me on its cover.

                    I managed a team of ten designers tasked with producing layouts and illustrations for The Cincinnati Enquirer, Asheville Citizen Times and The Greenville News. I met remotely with editors in Ohio, North Carolina and South Carolina to develop approaches for stories and led my team in implementing plans. My favorite project was on the revamped Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati, which featured hand-drawn type on the cover. In 2015, I received a Society for News Design award for my involvement with a redesign of the Asheville Citizen Times.
