        Senior Designer
        2018-2019 | USA Today | Gannett
        I worked with graphics and photo editors to produce editorial layouts for news, business and special sections. I developed the conceptualization and production of major reports and book-sized special sections and thrived under deadline pressure to craft designs and illustrations with little supervision. Partnering with National Geographic, I created pages to promote their series “Mars” as well as on endangered species and the Apollo 11 mission. As interim assistant team leader in 2018, I planned meetings with editors and assigned story projects to layout designers.


        Lead Designer
        2016-2018 | Asheville Citizen Times | Gannett
        I created layouts, illustrations and infographics for this newspaper based in the mountains of western North Carolina. I photo edited and designed a section on the life of evangelist Billy Graham, who lived in the region until his death in February 2018. I also assisted with a special section on the future of Mars exploration that was published across the country via various Gannett properties. In August 2017 I had the opportunity to design a special section in advance of what was dubbed “The Great American Eclipse” featuring an illustration by me on its cover.


        Design Team Leader
        2014-2016 | Louisville Design Studio | Gannett
        I managed a team of ten designers tasked with producing layouts and illustrations for The Cincinnati Enquirer, Asheville Citizen Times and The Greenville News. I met remotely with editors in Ohio, North Carolina and South Carolina to develop approaches for stories and led my team in implementing plans. My favorite project was on the revamped Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati, which featured hand-drawn type on the cover. In 2015, I received a Society for News Design award for my involvement with a redesign of the Asheville Citizen Times.


        Lead Designer
        2011-2014 | The Cincinnati Enquirer | Gannett
        I worked with editors, reporters, graphics artists and photographers to shape the visual design of various reporting efforts. I also created original artwork to illustrate stories and assisted with the publication’s 2013 redesign and change in format. I later developed a redesigned look for its front page. In August 2014 I designed a cover featuring my own photo illustration that later won a Society for News Design Award of Excellence.


        Copy Editor & Paginator
        2005-2011 | JGTC | Lee Enterprises
        Edited local stories, composed headlines and designed pages for news, features, sports and special sections. Assisted with daily planning and coordinated coverage of spot news events. I helped to redesign the publication’s website in 2006 and later redesigned the newspaper.


        Paginator, Graphic Artist
        2003-2005 | Pike Press | Campbell Publications
        Designed advertisements and page layouts for weekly newspapers in west central Illinois. Helped train the design staff during the transition from QuarkXpress to Adobe InDesign. I later redesigned the opinion pages for one of the company’s publications, the Pike Press.
